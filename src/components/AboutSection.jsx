        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-800 text-sm font-medium mt-1 text-justify">
          Assam University, Silchar is a Central University established by an
          Act of the Indian Parliament (Act XXIII of 1989), and came into
          existence in 1994. Situated in the Barak Valley of southern Assam, the
          University is nestled in a sprawling 600-acre campus at Dargakona,
          about 23 km from Silchar town. In 2007, Assam University opened a
          90-acre satellite campus at Diphu in the Karbi Anglong Hills District
          of Assam, thereby making quality higher education accessible to a
          wider section of society. With students’ strength about 5000 in both
          the campuses, the University is a veritable melting pot of diverse
          communities, ideas and creativity. Apart from the two campuses of the
          University, there are 73 affiliated and permitted colleges in the five
          districts of south Assam, which together constitute the jurisdiction
          of Assam University and there are more than 37,000 students enrolled
          in the affiliated colleges. <br /> <br />
          Since 1994, Assam University has expanded both in size and reputation.
          Today, there are 43 postgraduate departments under 16 schools of
          studies in the Silchar campus and 10 departments in Diphu campus,
          offering a wide range of programmes geared towards equipping students
          and research scholars with knowledge, skills, experience and
          confidence, the benefits of which they can reap well into the future.
          Besides, there are several Centres of Study in the University
          dedicated to research of high quality. Recently, the University has
          developed a strategy for enhancing the range of pedagogic uses of
          technology. As part of this strategy, the University is in the process
          of gradually turning all its classrooms into state-of-the-art ones
          enabling teachers to teach using a wide variety of media. There’s no
          gainsaying that in the last twenty eight years of its relentless
          pursuit of academic excellence, Assam University has made giant
          strides in providing better academic atmosphere and improved
          infrastructural facilities.
